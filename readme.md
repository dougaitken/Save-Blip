# Save Blip

### What? ðŸ“·

This originally started as a shell script put together by Tim Read after the news that [Polaroid Blipfoto](https://www.polaroidblipfoto.com/) (previously Blipfoto) was [entering into liquidation](http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/what-s-on/blipfoto-enters-liquidation-amid-funding-issues-1-3719772#axzz3r1vyxL00).
After a shell script and Windows Batch script, Tim wanted to go further. The original scripts simply took a screenshot of the journal page and saved this as a pdf, it didn't provide the original image. The next stage hopes to address this.

This is completely unrelated and not-endorsed by Blipfoto or PLR IP Holdings, LLC

## How? ðŸ’»

There are 2 scripts available to run in the terminal on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Please see the [website](https://www.dougaitken.co.uk/Save-Blip/) for more information regarding usage.
